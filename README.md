## 👋 About Me

I am an aspiring **Business & Data Analyst** with hands-on experience applying analytical thinking in operational environments. I have supported process optimization, improved reporting accuracy, and enabled better decision-making through structured, data-driven insights.

Currently, I am strengthening my skills in **analytics, statistics, SQL, and problem-solving** to transition into analytical roles where data can be leveraged to drive **business growth and operational excellence**.

I enjoy transforming raw data into clear, actionable insights that help teams work more efficiently and make informed decisions. I value clarity, impact, and continuous improvement, and I am always open to learning, collaboration, and meaningful professional connections.
